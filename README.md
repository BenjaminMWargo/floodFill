Piorities on whiteboard coding

1.Working code

2.Explaination

3.Performance

4.Show off

Algorithmns to know
1. Tree Traversal - Pre-order, In-order, Post-order, Breath first search, depth first search.Binary search. Both recursivly and iteratively

2. Recursion - Clear base case, helper fuctions to keep state, know limits due to stack space, know when to not sure recursion

3.Stacks and Queues - Iterative alternative to recursion

4.Object Oriented - classes, private var, public var.

5.Data Structures - HashMaps,HashSets,vector Alternative to arrays and lists. O(1) search time. Maps of objects, keyed on string int or object. Hashing fuction

6.Sorting - Quick sort, bubble sort, merg sort, Performance

7.String maipulation - Iterate, slice. Common question - Anagram/Pallandrome 




You are given a grid of undefined length and width containing Integers.

Find and print the size and value of the largest collection of connected squares with the same Integer.

Connected means touching from the top,bottom,left or right.
